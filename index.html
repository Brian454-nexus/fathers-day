      Dad, you've been my anchor, my guide, and my greatest role model.<br>
      Your strength, wisdom, and unwavering support have shaped me into the person I am today.<br><br>

      I cherish the lessons you've taught meâ€”<br>
      your work ethic, your integrity, and your quiet determination to always do what's right.<br>
      You've shown me what it means to be a man of character,<br>
      to stand tall in the face of challenges, and to love unconditionally.<br><br>

      Your sacrifices and dedication to our family have never gone unnoticed.<br>
      You are my hero, my mentor, and my friend.<br><br>

      Thank you for being the amazing father that you are.<br>
      Happy Father's Day, Dad.<br>
      Forever grateful to be your son. ðŸ’™<br><br>
