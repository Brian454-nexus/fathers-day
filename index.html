        Mom, you are my first home, my truest friend, and my forever queen. Your
        love is the greatest thing I could ever have. I carry your lessons in my heart every single dayâ€”the kindness
        you gave, the sacrifices you made, the nights you stayed up to pray for our family, the dreams you silenced so I could chase mine. There's no way to
        measure how much I owe youâ€¦ but just know this: I see you. I honor you.
        And I love you more than words could ever hold. Happy Mother's Day,
        Mama. Forever your son. ðŸ’–
        <br>Sir Brian TererðŸ˜Ž
